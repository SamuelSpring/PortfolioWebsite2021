        <p>My Java skills include creating command line and graphical applications including multiple classes and incorporating other libraries, java is the language
            that I mod games in the most and is my most proficient programming language. I utilize Object-oriented design and prgramming to create solutions to many
            complex tasks, for instance I have built a ground up fully functional command-line version of LinkedIn over the course of a semester using a framework provided
            by my instructor, this was a months long project and provided insight on the life cycle of working with code over long periods of time!

        <p>C++ is the language that I first learned when I began programming, I am extremely familiar with foundational concepts and I have learned many data structures and algorithms
            through C++ due to its "raw code" nature. I also am a C++ tutor through Sinclair Community College and I teach first year students beginner to mid level concepts as they
            work through their first and second semesters of coding.

            My HTML skills are on display with this website, I am familiar with good website structure and layout, element tags, inline styling, any many
            other foundational concepts. Typically I use HTML in addtion to CSS and JS.

            <img src="../Portfolio2021/img/css logo.png" width="120" height="120" alt="CSS Logo">
            My CSS skills are on par with my HTML skills as I typically use them in conjunction. I have been working in CSS for nearly 2 years and I am skilled in formatting webpages, 
            using media queries for responsive design for a variety of viewports and, simple animation to make websites appear more attractive.

        <div class="box-3">
            <img src="../Portfolio2021/img/js logo.png" width="120" height="120" alt="JS Logo">
          Much of my JS skills come from my other programming experience, I have used JS for almost 1 year to animate websites, create responsive design, and overall enchance my HTML and CSS.
